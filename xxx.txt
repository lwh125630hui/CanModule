    ixing OPCUA-1597: added feature so that you can use "vcan" now for socketcan@linux as well, please try out.
    fixed OPCISEG-119: user code called createBus() as well, so that method got called twice. Two problems solved:
    (1) only one reply-handler (from the first call) should be connected, the second call (and all subsequent calls for the same bus) to createBus() should be ignored.
    (2) the user code should not call createBus() explicitly but rather follow the API as documented. The createBus() has to be public unfortunately, by design. I am open to suggestions how to isolate this virtual public method from the user API. But with (1) already fixed, CanModule will only connect one reply-handler anyway , so the code will run correctly.
    documentation updated accordingly
